"helpContent" = "<h1>Can the app see my location?</h1>
<p>No. Using Bluetooth, the app only sees whether you're near other people who also have the app. Bluetooth isn't linked to your location, so the app can't see where you are. Bluetooth is only used to wirelessly connect 2 devices that are near each other. Like your phone and a speaker, or a pair of headphones.</p>
<h1>How can the app be anonymous?</h1>
<p>The app exchanges codes with other phones. These codes don't include any of your personal or location data. They're completely random. The code exchange happens when you're near a person who also has the app. </br></br>Does this person later turn out to have coronavirus? They can use the app to send their codes to the GGD. The GGD then makes a list of only infected people's codes. Sharing codes is only possible after the infected person gives the GGD a temporary password. Afterwards, you and all other people with these codes on their phone get a notification. This notification only tells you the date you've been near an infected person. Not who this person is, or where you've run into them.</p>
<h1>When does the app send notifications?</h1>
<p>You get a notification after you've experienced a higher risk of infection. This happens when you've spent 10 minutes near someone who later turns out to have coronavirus. That person must be using the app too. When you've been near an infected person, you have a higher risk of infection. The strength of the Bluetooth signal determines whether you've been close enough to get infected. Did someone cycle past you on the street? Then you won't get a notification later. Yes, the Bluetooth signal was strong enough because you were near each other. But you were near each other for such a short time your risk of infection is very low. Were you near someone on the train or in the office? Then you may get a notification later. The Bluetooth signal was strong enough and you were near each other for a longer amount of time.</p>
<h1>Can the Bluetooth signal pass through walls?</h1>
<p>Yes, but the signal is very weak. Bluetooth works best when your phone is in the same room as another person's phone. So the chance of you getting your neighbours' Bluetooth signal is very low. That also means you probably won't get a notification if your neighbour tests positive for coronavirus and you haven't been in the same room.</p>
<h1>How much power does Bluetooth use?</h1>
<p>The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy â€” a special kind of Bluetooth that only uses a tiny bit of power. How fast this drains your battery depends on your phone..</p>
